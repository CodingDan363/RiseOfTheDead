# Source Code

The files in this folder are hard links to the source code used in Rise of the Dead. Any changes in the main code will update these files automatically. Once commited, the changes will be visible you the public.

These are made available to make game documentation easier for people working on wikis and guides whereever you are posting and gives you the most up to date information.

These are mostly raw values so some numbers may not be intelligible on face value and you may need to refer back to the game to translate them, however, any changes to them will still be documented here.
